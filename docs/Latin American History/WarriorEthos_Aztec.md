## Warrior Ethos and Religious Life: Unveiling Aztec Society in Clendinnen's Analysis

In _The Cost of Courage in Aztec Society_, Inga Clendinnen embarks on a quest to demystify the Aztec perspective on warfare within the ancient city of Tenochtitlan, aiming to delve into the motivations and rationales behind the actions of Aztec warriors. Clendinnen's work is not about challenging existing narratives with groundbreaking theories; instead, she seeks to furnish a comprehensive understanding of the warrior ethos in Aztec culture. Her approach addresses the broader misinterpretations surrounding Aztec society, particularly concerning human sacrifice and cannibalism. Clendinnen argues that without a deep understanding of the pivotal roles ritual and religion played in Aztec life, contemporary assessments risk mislabeling the Aztecs as mere barbarians, akin to the uncivilized societies that came before them. This perspective, she contends, oversimplifies the complexities of Aztec civilization and obscures the true nature of their cultural practices and beliefs.

Clendinnen's article is rich with details about Aztec warrior culture, providing the reader with an array of facts, stories, and descriptions that enhance understanding. However, a significant concern arises from her omission of sources for these insights. The article lacks citations for the numerous block quotes and bold statements made throughout, leaving readers to question the origin of her information. For example, her assertion that defeat in battle marked the end of a warrior's status, transitioning them to a victim, is presented without any supporting evidence or reference. This claim is later seemingly contradicted by her description of warriors' sacrifice as a path to "warrior paradise," further complicating the narrative without clarification or source attribution. Despite Clendinnen's academic position at LaTrobe University, the absence of documented sources or even basic explanations for her information may leave some readers skeptical about the reliability of her account.

While Clendinnen offers an unbiased and objective exploration of Aztec warfare and religion, her work could be enriched by highlighting the broader achievements of Aztec society. Including details such as the cleanliness of the streets, the beauty of the gardens, and the sophistication of the canal system in Teotihuac√°n, as described in article V, would offer readers a more comprehensive understanding of Aztec civilization beyond its military aspects. This broader perspective might prevent readers from misconceiving Aztec life as predominantly war-focused. Article V sheds light on the importance of agriculture as the primary occupation for many Aztecs, with warfare and capturing enemies being more of an occasional endeavor. Additionally, incorporating early European perspectives on the Aztecs could provide valuable context, contrasting initial foreign views with contemporary understandings of Aztec society. Such an approach would not only deepen the appreciation for Aztec accomplishments but also offer a nuanced view of their culture in relation to external perceptions.

Clendinnen's article adeptly fulfills its primary aim of elucidating the significance of warfare within Aztec society, delivering a comprehensive and engaging narrative on the subject. Despite its shortcomings regarding source documentation and a broader exploration of Aztec life, the article is well-crafted and achieves its objective effectively.

One of the most striking aspects discussed is the option available for individuals to abstain from participating in warfare, choosing instead to live as agricultural workers. This choice, however, came with its social consequences, such as public humiliation and limited social mobility. This autonomy in decision-making underscores a unique aspect of Aztec warfare: the highly individualistic nature of combat. Aztec law prohibited soldiers from aiding each other in battle, emphasizing solo combat and discouraging cooperation under penalty of death. This approach contrasts sharply with European combat strategies, which focused on collective efforts to achieve political goals and eliminate opponents. The Aztec emphasis on capturing rather than killing placed them at a strategic disadvantage against the Europeans, who were experienced in lethal warfare tactics.

Furthermore, the article intriguingly points out the exclusion of captors from the sacrificial ceremony, a deviation from the typical glorification of warriors in many cultures. This seclusion, coupled with the captors' mourning for their captives, challenges the notion of eager participation in sacrifice and sheds light on the complex emotions involved. The pre-sacrifice rituals that captors undergo, marked by reflection and mourning, introduce a profound dimension to Aztec warfare, suggesting that the societal value placed on sacrifice may have been met with ambivalence by the warriors themselves. These insights prompt a reevaluation of the Aztec warrior ethos and the societal norms surrounding sacrifice, offering a nuanced perspective on the role and perceptions of warriors in Aztec culture.
