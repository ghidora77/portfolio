# Writing

It recently occurred to me how much I've written. Between college, graduate studies and just throwing together a few paragraphs when I felt like it, I've unwittingly built quite a collection. But what was the point? Words sitting in my electronic folder system don't do me (or anyone else) any good, so I've been going through the process of putting together a portfolio. A sizable amount of my work doesn't deserve to see the light of the internet, but I've been combing through ones with potential, cleaning them up and putting them into a logical order. Hopefully you get some use out of this writing. 

Note that this writing skews more towards the humanities. In recent years, I've moved towards computer science and remote sensing (satellite imagery), but I still try and stay engaged with international relations, history and design.
