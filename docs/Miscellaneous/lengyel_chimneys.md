## Voices from the Ashes: A Review of Lengyel's 'Five Chimneys

In _Five Chimneys_, Olga Lengyel embarks on a mission to memorialize those silenced by the atrocities of World War II's concentration camps. Without seeking to advance any grandiose theory or hidden agenda, Lengyel's narrative emerges from a place of profound sincerity and purpose: to lend a voice to the voiceless and to share her own harrowing journey through the abyss of Nazi persecution. Through her candid and detailed recounting of events—from the initial dehumanizing process of being corralled into trains to the painful act of remembering the irreplaceable losses suffered—Lengyel crafts a work that transcends mere memoir. Her narrative stands as a poignant testament to the individuals and stories that might otherwise fade into the forgotten margins of history. With stark honesty and vivid detail, "Five Chimneys" serves not only as a crucial historical document but also as a powerful reminder of the depths of human cruelty and the resilience of the human spirit.

"Mea culpa, my fault, mea maxima culpa!" With these words, Olga Lengyel embarks on her narrative in "Five Chimneys," not with accusations towards the Germans, the Nazis, bystanders, or even the nations that remained inactive during the Holocaust. Instead, she directs her blame inward, mourning her perceived failures towards her family, who perished under Nazi tyranny. Intriguingly, Lengyel's account is devoid of direct rage against Hitler and his regime. Despite her clear condemnation of their heinous actions, she somehow views the Germans through a lens that borders on resigned acceptance, recognizing their cruelty yet refraining from labeling her circumstances as unjust.

Lengyel's narrative reveals a complex relationship with her oppressors; she acknowledges their malevolence but chooses to navigate her survival within the oppressive framework they established. This includes viewing acts of theft for survival—taking food and clothing from Nazis—as morally wrong, adhering to a prisoner's code imposed by her captors. This perspective is remarkably nuanced, showcasing Lengyel's struggle with guilt, morality, and the instinct for self-preservation under unimaginable circumstances. Her stance reflects an unexpected dimension of the human spirit's adaptability and resilience, even when faced with the utmost dehumanization and loss.

The recounting of Olga Lengyel's loss of her entire family in "Five Chimneys" is profoundly moving, offering stark contrast to the relatively minor troubles faced by contemporary society. The vivid imagery of parting from loved ones, with the harrowing realization of having unknowingly directed her mother towards a tragic fate, underscores the depth of personal agony encapsulated within the broader historical tragedy of the Holocaust. Lengyel's narrative does more than recount events; it viscerally conveys the emotional toll of each loss, transforming statistics into stories of individual despair and longing.

Photographs of Holocaust victims often fail to convey the full scope of their suffering, presenting faces without stories, reducing lives to mere images. Lengyel's firsthand account restores their humanity, reminding us that behind each photo was a person with a family, dreams, and a desire to live. Her detailed memories serve as a bridge, enabling readers to emotionally and spiritually connect with the victims, imagining the pain of endless separations and the weight of loss. Through Lengyel's eyes, we are offered a glimpse into the hearts of those who endured the unthinkable, inviting deep empathy and reflection on the true cost of hatred and intolerance.

Olga Lengyel's account of weighing prisoners weekly in "Five Chimneys" provides a stark illustration of the extreme conditions within the concentration camps. The comparison between the average human weight and the drastically reduced weights of camp prisoners—adults diminishing to as little as 40 pounds—highlights the severe malnutrition and inhumanity they endured. This harrowing detail emphasizes not just the physical degradation inflicted upon the prisoners but also the psychological torment of witnessing such degradation without the power to intervene.

The fact that guards compounded this suffering with brutal beatings adds a layer of cruelty to the already unimaginable conditions of the camps. The ability of Holocaust survivors to endure such atrocities and yet remain committed to ensuring that these events are remembered speaks volumes about their resilience and the human spirit's capacity for survival and remembrance. Lengyel's narrative serves as a powerful reminder of the depths of human cruelty as well as the strength found in the resolve to bear witness to suffering and to honor those who were lost.

The liberation from the concentration camps is often depicted as a moment of unbridled joy, yet Olga Lengyel's recounting in "Five Chimneys" paints a more complex picture, marked by the indelible scars of haunting memories. Among the most harrowing is her recollection of being compelled to lead young children to an icy river for a so-called "bath" during the peak of winter, a cruel method devised by the Nazis to conserve resources while still ensuring the children's deaths. The vivid depiction of this act, and the immediate execution of any who survived the freezing water, starkly illustrates the depths of cruelty inflicted upon the prisoners and the impossible positions in which they were placed.

Lengyel's burden of guilt for her role in these events underscores a profound and disturbing aspect of the Holocaust: the Nazis' manipulation of victims into complicity with their own dehumanization. Her reflection that the "greatest crime" was the Nazis' success in forcing victims to act against one another highlights a particularly insidious form of psychological torture. Despite her unbearable memories and the heavy weight of her actions, Lengyel's refusal to absolve herself of responsibility speaks to a remarkable sense of integrity and moral clarity. She confronts her past with a brutal honesty, acknowledging her actions without seeking justification, all the while emphasizing the Nazis' manipulation and coercion.

Lengyel's narrative offers a crucial insight into the complex legacy of survival, marked not only by the physical endurance of unimaginable horrors but also by the enduring struggle with guilt and responsibility. Her account serves as a stark reminder of the Holocaust's lasting impact on individual lives, challenging simplistic narratives of liberation and highlighting the enduring need for understanding, compassion, and remembrance.

Olga Lengyel's _Five Chimneys_ stands out for its raw honesty and emotional depth, making it a poignant and essential read for understanding the Holocaust. Lengyel's intention goes beyond merely recounting her harrowing experiences in Birkenau; she aims to serve as a cautionary tale, a beacon of awareness to ensure the atrocities of the Holocaust are never repeated. Her narrative resonates deeply, allowing readers to feel the spectrum of emotions she endured, from despair to a persevering hope for humanity.

Lengyel's commitment to truth-telling is driven by a desire to honor those lost by preventing future genocides. Her belief in the fundamental goodness of humanity, despite the evil she witnessed and experienced, underscores a message of resilience and moral responsibility. She implores the world to recognize the dangers of unchecked hatred and to collectively work towards preventing such tragedies.

_Five Chimneys_ is not just a memoir; it's a call to action, a reminder of the depths to which humanity can sink and the heights of compassion and understanding it can achieve. It's a testament to the strength of the human spirit and the enduring hope for a better, more humane world. As one of the most significant Holocaust survivor memoirs, _Five Chimneys_ is a crucial read for anyone committed to learning from the past to shape a more compassionate future.
