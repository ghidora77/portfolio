  "description": "It recently occurred to me how much I've written. Between college, graduate studies and just throwing together a few paragraphs when I felt like it, I've unwittingly built quite a collection. But, what was the point? Words sitting in my electronic folder system don't do me (or anyone else) any good, so I've been going through the process of putting together a portfolio. A sizable amount of my work doesn't deserve to see the light of the internet, but I've been combing through ones with potential, cleaning them up and putting them into a logical order. Hopefully you get some use out of this writing.",
