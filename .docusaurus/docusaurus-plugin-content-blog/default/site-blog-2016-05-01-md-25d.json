  "title": "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance - Part 01",
  "description": "If you’ve been involved in design, art, philosophy, or even delved into the rebellious counter-culture of college, you’ve likely read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. Other than some academic tomes, it is one of the most philosophically dense books out there, but written in a subtle, accessible way. I found myself unable to put it down at times, especially when he goes down the rabbit hole of defining the metaphysics of quality, melding the fine balance between art and science, mysticism vs. positivism, or the role of happiness versus contentment. If you find yourself thinking about the aesthetics of environment, the purpose of your occupation or livelihood, or even just interested in hiking through a philosophical quest with an obviously well versed narrator, read this book. But I won’t end this as a wide-eyed, fawning review.",
