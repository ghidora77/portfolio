  "description": "The past five years have seen a string of popular books discussing the future of the economy, labor, artificial intelligence, and our failing education system, but perhaps nobody explains it better than Joi Ito and Jeff Howe, both of the MIT Media Lab. Whiplash, a series of nine basic principles on how to interact in this mercurial new world, breaks it down for those of us working to find our fit. As someone who has struggled to balance entrepreneurial excitement with the security of a day job, the simplicity of the explanations and the profoundly new way of thinking had me sitting back and re-evaluating my whole life plan. Here’s a chapter title: Compasses over Maps. These three words challenge the fundamental principles of blindly accepting the knowledge passed down to us as a finished product. Just like roads are built, populations shift, cities grow and rural towns die, knowledge is ephemeral. It comes and goes, it morphs into something else and escapes our grasp once we thought we had it all figured out. There is a fascination today with handing down “packets” of information, in essence giving us both the problems and the answers in an easy to digest formula, but adds little to our intrinsic development. Granted, these “packets” can be incredibly useful if taken apart, analyzed in different contexts and then re-applied to real-world problems. But this reliance placates our curiosity, it calms our racing mind, puts us into a state of acceptance. After all, everything we need is right there, why go searching? Why question it? We are then steered to continue segmenting knowledge into specific realms, producing “specialists” and systems that favor those that have experience following specific procedures.",
