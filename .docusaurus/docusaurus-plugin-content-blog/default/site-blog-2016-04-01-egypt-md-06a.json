  "title": "Egypt - US Relations in 2016",
  "description": "The moments of coherence in US policy towards Egypt have been sparse, at best. The strongman Mubarak enjoyed full US support, until he apparently lost it as the US attempted to position itself as an agent of change in the region. The democratic election to follow showcased several uninspiring candidates, and the Muslim Brotherhood's fallback choice narrowly won against the former prime minister from the regime Egypt had just overthrown. Paralyzed by indecision, US State Department officials eschewed groups such as the National Salvation Front, which stated their demand for liberal democracy clearly, in an attempt to ingratiate itself with the incoming government. Morsi's decree of power, which gave him authority to operate without judicial oversight and consolidate more power than Mubarak ever had, were met with bland responses from the US State Department: \"The decisions and declarations announced on November 22nd raise concerns for many Egyptians and for the international community.\" In fact, the US went ahead with weapon transfers of F-16 fighter aircraft, and was on track to transfer two hundred M1A1 Abrams tanks before Morsi's overthrow (it is puzzling as to the US objective of providing the Muslim Brotherhood tanks, which have little value in combating Egypt's low-level insurgency - their most effective role would be in the de-militarized Sinai against Israel, which critics were quick to point out). Then, Egyptian politics took another turn, as Morsi's general incompetence in running the country led to an economic collapse, energy price spikes, food shortages and authoritarian heavy-handedness. Seventeen million Egyptians took to the streets and the military took charge; more chaos, more unrest, another round of presidential elections and a leadership changeover. The only constant has been US vacillation on the sidelines.",
