  "description": "The New Yorker recently wrote an article about the Imperial Valley in California and the neighboring Salton sea; while the state suffers from a devastating four-year drought, the Imperial Valley has used its water seniority from the Colorado river to sustain its livelihood and farming activities, which reduces the water supply to San Diego. A common refrain consists of criticizing the water-thirsty urbanites and lauding the right of small communities to exist in the rapidly globalized, conglomerated world of hyper-expanding metropolises. Indeed, San Diego has few fresh water sources, while its population has exploded to well over three million flocking to its Mediterranean climate and biotechnology sector. Desalination and local water recycling yield moderate advancements, but full-scale application is not yet thereâ€¦nor will it be for decades. Although the quest towards building a sustainable water cycle is noble, society has to balance future potential with immediate needs.",
